Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG, Alexnet, and Resnet have predicted the breed correctly and the same prediction which is (The Golden Retriever)


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Alexnet prediected the dog_02 as (chihuahua), also Resnet predicted the dog_02 as (saluki, gazelle hound), lastly VGG managed to predict dog_01, and dog_02 breed correctly which is (The Golden Retriever)


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Actually all the models reported them as not dog


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG architecture is the best, because it predicted the dog breed while it rotating 180 degree, and other architectures did not manage that, also it has the ability to classifiy non-dogs images correctly, in terms of time to execute or predict VGG took 8 second, compared with one second from Alexnet, and 4 seconds with Resent, so I think it is better in low-intensive datasets, but if we had let us say (10m) image, I might go with Alexnet as a way to trade-off between the model accuracy, and the execution time.
